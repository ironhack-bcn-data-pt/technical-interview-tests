3. SQL (25 points) In the orders table you can find orderline data. (Feel free to use
the data order.csv to help with the process)
- created_at : timestamp of when order is created
- order_number : self-explanatory
- sku: unique reference for each product
- total_order_price: self explanatory
- code: the discount code applied to this order

Use SQL query to answer the following questions:
1. How many orders/day? How much sales per day?
2. What is the top selling product?
3. What percentage of orders are with discount codes?
4. What percentage of orders include the product with SKU PM591?
5. Which hour of day do people buy most products?


7. Python (25 points) In the file price_analytics.csv you have the product sales
history within one product category. As we are planning a promotion for our top
sellers, please identify the top 2 products( we will refer to them as No.1 and No.2) and
answer the following questions with detailed analytics:
1. How much price should we drop for top seller No.2 to encourage more sales?
2. Would lowering the price of No.2 impact the sales of product No.1? If so, how
much?
3. Should we also drop the price for product No.1? How would your decision
impact the performance of the category performance?
